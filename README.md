# Customer Churn Analysis
This repository contains the code and resources for a Customer Churn Data Analysis project conducted entirely using Power BI. The project aims to analyze customer churn data, derive actionable insights, and recommend strategies to improve customer retention for businesses, particularly those in subscription-based or recurring revenue models.

Overview
Customer churn, or attrition, is a critical metric for businesses. Understanding and addressing churn can help organizations enhance customer satisfaction, optimize retention strategies, and reduce loss in revenue. This project uses Power BI to analyze customer behavior and churn patterns, providing businesses with insights to take proactive measures.

Key Objectives of the Project:
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use Power BI visualizations to explore the dataset, detect patterns, correlations, and outliers.
Churn Rate Calculation and Trend Analysis: Calculate churn rates, track trends over time, and examine which factors correlate with churn.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that might enhance churn prediction and uncover additional insights.
Predictive Modeling: Use Power BI’s built-in predictive capabilities to forecast future churn based on historical trends.
Visualization of Insights and Recommendations: Create interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to communicate key findings and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.
Project Steps:
Data Collection:

Collected customer data from various sources, including CRM systems, transaction logs, and customer surveys.
Data included customer demographics, transaction history, service usage, and support interactions.
Data Preparation:

Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness.
Removed outliers, handled missing data, and transformed variables to improve model accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed initial data exploration using Power BI’s visual tools, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms.
Identified key churn drivers, customer segments, and patterns in churn behavior.
Churn Analysis:

Defined churn criteria (e.g., customer canceling subscription or being inactive for a certain period).
Analyzed churn rates by demographics, customer segments, and time trends.
Used Power BI's time series charts and trend analysis features to visualize churn trends over time.
Predictive Modeling:

Applied Power BI’s built-in forecasting models to predict future churn rates.
Evaluated potential risk factors and used predictive insights to understand future churn scenarios.
Visualization and Reporting:

Designed interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to present key metrics such as churn rate, customer lifetime value (CLV), and at-risk segments.
Provided actionable recommendations for reducing churn, improving retention strategies, and enhancing customer satisfaction.
Technologies Used:
Power BI (for data visualization, reporting, and predictive modeling)
SQL (for data extraction and manipulation)
Excel (for data preprocessing and cleaning)
Key Takeaways:
Gained valuable insights into the drivers of customer churn and identified specific customer segments at risk of leaving.
Developed a robust predictive model to forecast churn and provided recommendations on how businesses can address customer retention more effectively.
Delivered a set of interactive dashboards in Power BI that help stakeholders understand and act upon the churn insights in real-time.
