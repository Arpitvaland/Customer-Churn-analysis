**Customer Churn Analysis**
This repository contains the code and resources for a Customer Churn Data Analysis project conducted using Power BI. The project analyzes customer churn data to derive actionable insights and recommend strategies for improving customer retention, particularly for businesses with subscription-based or recurring revenue models.

**Overview**
Customer churn, or attrition, is a crucial metric for businesses. By understanding and addressing churn, organizations can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize retention strategies, and reduce revenue loss. This project leverages Power BI to analyze customer behavior and churn patterns, providing actionable insights to help businesses proactively address churn.

**Project Objectives**
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Preparing the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Power BI visualizations to explore the dataset, detect patterns, correlations, and identify outliers.
Churn Rate Calculation and Trend Analysis: Calculating churn rates, tracking trends over time, and identifying factors correlated with churn.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve churn prediction and uncover additional insights.
Predictive Modeling: Using Power BI’s built-in forecasting capabilities to predict future churn based on historical data.
Visualization of Insights and Recommendations: Developing interactive dashboards and reports to present findings and provide actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

**Project Steps**
Data Collection

Collected customer data from multiple sources, including CRM systems, transaction logs, and customer surveys.

Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness.

Performed initial data exploration using Power BI visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms.

Defined churn criteria (e.g., customer canceling subscription or being inactive for a certain period).

Applied Power BI’s built-in forecasting models to predict future churn rates.
